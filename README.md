# Casino Simulation

# Synopsis: 
Simulate a casino environment from the standpoint of the casino management. Track money,
games, users, etc. Will need many casino games (and multiple versions of the same games) to be run
in a statistically accurate environment (blackjack, poker, roulette, craps, slots, etc.). Must have multiple
users of different strategies and bankrolls. Track user gambling history (wins, losses, games). Record
the amount lost/won individually and for the entire casino.

# Required
Testing: Give same “random” seeds, same users, same games, test for gains/losses.
Database: users, games, history of players (high-rollers) and gains/losses, list of cheaters.
Search/sort/data structure: see above, be able to search.
Other functionality: mimic real random games by the 100s, track dealers, players, games over
some time period, graph gain/loss for any player or the casino or game over various time
intervals, integrate new game and determine efficacy of adding it, simulate new rules to old
games to see if it helps/hurts the casino; run long-term simulations and determine best number
of each game to maximize profit.
